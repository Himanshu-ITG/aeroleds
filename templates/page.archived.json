All SunSpot Series LED aircraft lights consume less power, produce more lumens (total light output), and are not affected by vibrations compared to incandescent bulbs. These attributes make the SunSpot ideal for most aircraft. SunSpot outputs a wider beam at a color temperature that illuminates the true color of an object. This provides exceptional color rendering as opposed to “grayed” out images from the orange-red color temperature of an incandescent lamp.

This provides exceptional color rendering as opposed to “grayed” out images from the orange-red color temperature of an incandescent lamp.
