Adding more lumens increases the total amount of light, but the candela remains constant. As the area of light distribution decreases, candela increases. High candela alone does not make a good landing light, just a good marketing number. A 0.5 milliwatt pocket laser pointer is around 2 million candelas compared to a bare 100W incandescent bulb, which is 300 candela. Both lumens and candela are equally important. A good landing light needs enough lumens for the pilot to have a peripheral vision of the runway and enough candela to see far down the runway. AeroLEDs lights provide an optimum balance between lumens and candela.</em></p>",
